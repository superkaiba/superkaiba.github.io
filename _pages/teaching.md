### MAIS 202 (Intro to ML)
##### Technical Project Manager

Since September 2021, I have been a Technical Project Manager for the McGill A.I. Society's Accelerated Introduction to Machine Learning Bootcamp. 

This requires me to hold weekly office hours, create and grade assignments, develop and present workshops, and help students with their final machine learning related project throughout the semester.

The syllabus from Winter 2022 can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YvcDkclmCaJTe8noQ255nguuGGZlP4eL-jUryjiw8Ug/edit#heading=h.y1ncjdpj4e3b) and final projects from students I supervised can be found [here](https://w2020-mais-202-bootcamp.devpost.com/project-gallery) and [here](https://mais202-fall2021.devpost.com/project-gallery).

Applications to participate in the course usually begin in September for the Fall semester and in January for the Winter
semester. The application process includes a coding challenge as well as a technical interview. Follow the McGill A.I. Society's [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/McGillAI) to be notified when applications open.
