I'm an undergraduate student in my last year at McGill in the Joint Honours Mathematics and Computer Science program! My research interests include reinforcement learning, the creative powers of neural networks, and natural language processing.

I am currently an intern at AWS in the S3 team, where I am working on a tool to automate the Incremental Backup recovery system, an undergraduate researcher at Mila with Professor Doina Precup, where I conduct research on combining options with affordances in a MiniGrid environment, and a Technical Project Manager for the McGill A.I. Society, where I help to organize, run, and teach the Accelerated Introduction to ML Bootcamp every semester.
