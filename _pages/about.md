I am an undergraduate student in my last year at __McGill University__ in the Joint Honours Mathematics and Computer Science program! My research interests include reinforcement learning, the creative powers of neural networks, and natural language processing.

I am currently:

- An __SDE intern at AWS in the S3 team__, where I am working on a tool to automate the Incremental Backup recovery system
- An __undergraduate researcher at Mila with Professor Doina Precup__, where I conduct research on combining options with affordances in a MiniGrid environment
- A __Technical Project Manager for the McGill A.I. Society__, where I help to organize, run, and teach the Accelerated Introduction to ML Bootcamp every semester.
