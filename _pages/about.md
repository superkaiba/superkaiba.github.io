I am a first year Master's student in computer science co-supervised by __[Yoshua Bengio](https://yoshuabengio.org/)__ and __[Doina Precup](https://mila.quebec/en/person/doina-precup/)__ at __[Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/)__ and __[Université de Montréal](https://www.umontreal.ca/)__. 

I am also currently completing a research internship at __[Waabi](https://waabi.ai/)__, where I am working with __[Kelvin Wong](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kelvinwong/)__ and __[Chris Zhang](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~cjhzhang/)__ on developing a realistic probabilistic traffic simulation using deep generative models.

I am interested in taking inspiration from human cognition to develop independent and useful artificial intelligence systems which have a positive impact on society.

I completed my Bachelor's in Honours Computer Science at __[McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/)__ where I worked with __[Professor Blake Richards](https://www.mcgill.ca/neuro/blake-richards-phd)__ and __[Dr. Chen Sun](https://linclab.mila.quebec/team/chen)__ in the __[LiNC lab](https://linclab.mila.quebec/home)__ on identifying important states for reinforcement learning in sparse reward environments, as well as with __[Professor Doina Precup](https://mila.quebec/en/person/doina-precup/)__ and __[Dr. Khimya Khetarpal](https://kkhetarpal.github.io/)__ in the __[Reasoning and Learning Lab](http://rl.cs.mcgill.ca/)__ on temporally extended models and planning using option models in pixel environments.

I was previously a __machine learning intern at the [Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence](https://vectorinstitute.ai/)__, where I developed a reinforcement learning system for energy efficient data center HVAC control, did __research on statistical modelling with [Professor Christian Genest](https://www.math.mcgill.ca/cgenest/)__ and __[Dr. Bouchra Nasri](https://www.bouchrarnasri.com/)__ from the McGill Department of Mathematics and Statistics, completed internships at __AWS__, __Expedia__ and __Square Enix__,  and was a __Teaching Assistant for COMP206 (Software Systems) at McGill__.

I was also previously a __Technical Project Manager for the [McGill A.I. Society](https://mcgillai.com/__, where I helped to organize, run, and teach __[MAIS 202](https://mcgillai.com/mais202)__, the Accelerated Introduction to ML Bootcamp, every semester (~30 students), and performed administrative tasks for the club. I am now a __Senior Advisor for the [McGill A.I. Society](https://mcgillai.com/)__, giving general advice and guidance to current club members.
