I am a Master's student in computer science co-supervised by __[Yoshua Bengio](https://yoshuabengio.org/)__ and __[Doina Precup](https://mila.quebec/en/person/doina-precup/)__ at __[Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/)__ and __[Université de Montréal](https://www.umontreal.ca/)__. I previously completed my Bachelor's in honours computer science at __[McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/)__ working with __[Blake Richards](https://mila.quebec/en/person/blake-richards/)__ and __[Doina Precup](https://cs.mcgill.ca/~dprecup/)__.

__I am broadly interested in building AI systems that have more human-like capabilities such as out-of-distribution generalization, compositional reasoning, long-term planning, and efficient learning, as well as applying AI to projects that have a concrete positive impact on society__.

To this end, my current research directions include:
- Incorporating ideas from __cognitive science__, __neuroscience__, __psychology__, and __causality__ into our AI models (__[example](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/file/6357d6d068622c962391081d296bed69-Paper-Conference.pdf)__)

- Exploiting the common-sense/world-knowledge capabilities of __LLMs__ and __VLMs__ to train/improve our AI models (__[example](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01207.pdf)__)

- Applying AI to projects related to __healthcare__, __drug discovery__, __climate change__, and __autonomous driving__ (__[example](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/26862)__)

<!-- 
My primary research interests are:
- Incorporating ideas from __cognitive science__, __neuroscience__, and __causality__ into our AI models/RL agents in order to give them more human-like capabilities such as __out-of-distribution generalization__, __compositional reasoning__, and __long-term planning__

- Exploiting the capabilities of __LLMs__ to help train/improve our AI models/RL agents

<!-- - Understanding the capabilities and limitations of __LLMs__/__diffusion models__ as well as developing new LLM/diffusion model architectures/training paradigms -->
<!-- 
- Applying artificial intelligence to projects that have a __concrete positive impact on society__, by tackling problems related to __drug discovery__, __healthcare__, __climate change__, __autonomous driving__, etc. --> 

I am currently:

I completed my Bachelor's in Honours Computer Science at __[McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/)__ where I worked with __[Professor Blake Richards](https://www.mcgill.ca/neuro/blake-richards-phd)__ and __[Dr. Chen Sun](https://linclab.mila.quebec/team/chen)__ on identifying important states for reinforcement learning in sparse reward environments, as well as with __[Professor Doina Precup](https://mila.quebec/en/person/doina-precup/)__ and __[Dr. Khimya Khetarpal](https://kkhetarpal.github.io/)__ on temporally extended models and planning using option models in pixel environments.

I was also previously an intern at __[Expedia](https://www.expedia.ca/)__, __[Square Enix](https://www.square-enix.com/)__, __[Amazon](https://www.amazon.ca/)__, the __[Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/)__ and __[Waabi](https://waabi.ai/)__, as well as a __Technical Project Manager for the [McGill A.I. Society](https://mcgillai.com/)__, where I helped to organize, run, and teach __[MAIS 202](https://mcgillai.com/mais202)__, the Accelerated Introduction to ML Bootcamp every semester.

In 2022, I was a part of McGill's team in __[Project X](https://www.uoft.ai/projectx)__, a machine learning research competition organized by the University of Toronto. Our paper on using deep conservative reinforcement learning for mechanical ventilation treatment (which I co-first authored) received the highest score out of all 25 papers submitted to the competition, winning in the clinical practice category. 

I was also fortunate to be selected to participate in the __[10th Heidelberg Laureate Forum](https://www.heidelberg-laureate-forum.org/forum/10th-hlf-2023.html)__. -->
In my free time, I enjoy traveling, writing sad songs, and watching/analyzing good movies!
