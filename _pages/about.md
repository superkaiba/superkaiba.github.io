I am an undergraduate student in my last year at __McGill University__ in the Joint Honours Mathematics and Computer Science program! My research interests include reinforcement learning, the creative powers of neural networks, and natural language processing.

I currently hold the following positions:

- __SDE intern at AWS in the S3 team__, where I am working on a tool to automate the Incremental Backup recovery system
- __Undergraduate researcher at McGill/Mila with Professor Doina Precup__, where I conduct deep reinforcement learning research on combining options with affordances in a MiniGrid environment
- __Technical Project Manager for the McGill A.I. Society__, where I help to organize, run, and teach the Accelerated Introduction to ML Bootcamp every semester.
