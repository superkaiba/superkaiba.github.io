I'm an undergraduate student in my last year at McGill in the Joint Honours Mathematics and Computer Science program! My research interests include reinforcement learning, the creative powers of neural networks, and natural language processing.

I am currently:

- An __SDE intern__ at __AWS__ in the __S3 team__, where I am working on a tool to automate the Incremental Backup recovery system
- An __undergraduate researcher at Mila__ with Professor Doina Precup, where I conduct research on combining options with affordances in a MiniGrid environment
- A __Technical Project Manager__ for the __McGill A.I. Society__, where I help to organize, run, and teach the Accelerated Introduction to ML Bootcamp every semester.
