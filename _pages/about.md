I am an undergraduate student in my last year at __McGill University__ in the Joint Honours Mathematics and Computer Science program! My research interests include reinforcement learning, the creative powers of neural networks, and natural language processing. I am also passionate about game development, and have developed multiple games which can be found in the "Projects" tab.

I currently hold the following positions:

- __SDE intern at AWS in the S3 team__ (since May 2022), where I am working on a tool to automate the Incremental Backup recovery system
- __Undergraduate researcher at McGill/Mila with Professor Doina Precup__ (since January 2022), where I conduct deep reinforcement learning research on combining options with affordances in a MiniGrid environment
- __Technical Project Manager for the McGill A.I. Society__ (since April 2021), where I help to organize, run, and teach the Accelerated Introduction to ML Bootcamp every semester (~30 students), and perform administrative tasks for the club

I previously did research on statistical modelling with Professor Christian Genest from the McGill Department of Mathematics and Statistics, completed internships at __Expedia__ and __Square Enix__,  and was a Teaching Assistant for COMP206 (Software Systems) at McGill.
