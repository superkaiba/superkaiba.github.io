I am an undergraduate student in my last year at __McGill University__ in the __Honours Computer Science__ progam! 

My primary research goal is to take inspiration from human cognition to develop independent and useful artificial intelligence systems which have a positive impact on society.

I currently think that the best way to do this is by using __deep reinforcement learning__ agents which develop human-like intelligence in the pursuit of reward maximization. 

The current research questions which I am focused on in pursuit of this overarching goal are:

- __How can we develop reinforcement learning agents which are able to plan far ahead into the future in complex environments?__

- __How can we develop reinforcement learning argents which generalize well from one complex environment/task to another?__

- __How can we apply the reinforcement learning agents we develop to important real-world societal tasks?__

I presently hold the following positions:
- __Machine Learning Intern at the Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence__ (since September 2022), where I am developing a reinforcement learning system for energy efficient data center HVAC control
- __Undergraduate researcher at Mila ([LiNC lab](https://linclab.mila.quebec/home)) with Professor Blake Richards__ (since September 2022), where I conduct deep reinforcement learning research on learning in environments with sparse rewards
- __Undergraduate researcher at Mila ([Reasoning and Learning Lab](http://rl.cs.mcgill.ca/)) with Professor Doina Precup__ (since January 2022), where I conduct deep reinforcement learning research on temporally extended models and planning using option models
- __Technical Project Manager for the McGill A.I. Society__ (since April 2021), where I help to organize, run, and teach the Accelerated Introduction to ML Bootcamp every semester (~30 students), and perform administrative tasks for the club

I previously did __research on statistical modelling with Professor Christian Genest__ from the McGill Department of Mathematics and Statistics, completed internships at __AWS__, __Expedia__ and __Square Enix__,  and was a __Teaching Assistant for COMP206 (Software Systems) at McGill__.
