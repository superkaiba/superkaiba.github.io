I am a first year Master's student in computer science co-supervised by __[Yoshua Bengio](https://yoshuabengio.org/)__ and __[Doina Precup](https://mila.quebec/en/person/doina-precup/)__ at Mila/Université de Montréal. 

I am also currently completing a research internship at __[Waabi](https://waabi.ai/)__, where I am working with __[Kelvin Wong](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kelvinwong/)__ and __[Chris Zhang](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~cjhzhang/)__ on developing a realistic probabilistic traffic simulation using deep generative models.

I am interested in taking inspiration from human cognition to develop independent and useful artificial intelligence systems which have a positive impact on society.

I completed my Bachelor's in Honours Computer Science at McGill University where I worked with __[Professor Blake Richards](https://www.mcgill.ca/neuro/blake-richards-phd)__ and __[Dr. Chen Sun](https://linclab.mila.quebec/team/chen)__ in the __[LiNC lab](https://linclab.mila.quebec/home)__ on identifying important states for reinforcement learning in sparse reward environments, as well as with __Professor Doina Precup__ and __[Dr. Khimya Khetarpal](https://kkhetarpal.github.io/)__ in the __[Reasoning and Learning Lab](http://rl.cs.mcgill.ca/)__ on temporally extended models and planning using option models in pixel environments.

I previously was a __Technical Project Manager for the McGill A.I. Society__, where I helped to organize, run, and teach the Accelerated Introduction to ML Bootcamp every semester (~30 students), and perform administrative tasks for the club. I am now a __Senior Advisor for the McGill A.I. Society__, giving general advice and guidance to current club members.

I was also previously a __machine learning intern at the Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence__, where I developed a reinforcement learning system for energy efficient data center HVAC control, did __research on statistical modelling with Professor Christian Genest__ from the McGill Department of Mathematics and Statistics, completed internships at __AWS__, __Expedia__ and __Square Enix__,  and was a __Teaching Assistant for COMP206 (Software Systems) at McGill__.
